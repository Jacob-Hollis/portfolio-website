          Hello! My name is <span>Jacob</span> (but most of the time I go by <span>Jake</span>) and I enjoy solving complex real-world problems and building impactful solutions.
          My interest in coding and software development began way back when as a kid I discovered how to code games in Lua.
          That early experience motivated me to explore programming in college, which led to my current career as a software engineer.
          <br>
          <p class="bio">
          In the present, I primarily work with <span>C#</span>, <span>Java</span>, and <span>Python</span> but I am always learning and exploring new technologies, 
          so you may see me tinkering around with other frameworks such as <span>Django</span> (hey that's what this website is built with ðŸ˜‰), <span>React</span>, <span>Ruby</span>, and many others.
          <br>
          <p class="bio">
          If you want to see the full list of technologies I work with, head over to my skills:

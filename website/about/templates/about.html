            Hello! My name is <span>Jacob</span> (but most people call me <span>Jake</span>) and I enjoy solving complex problems and building impactful solutions.
            My interest in coding and software development began way back when kid I discovering I could edit Lua scripts on a little online game called Roblox.
            That early experience motivated me to explore programming in college, and now I live it every day as a software engineer.

          <p class="bio">
            In the present, I primarily work with <span>C#</span>, <span>Java</span>, and <span>Python</span> but I am always learning and exploring new technologies, 
            so you may see me tinkering around with other frameworks such as <span>Django</span> (hey that's what this website is built with!), <span>React</span>, <span>Ruby</span>, and many others.
          <br>
